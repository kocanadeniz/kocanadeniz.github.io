I am a 5th year PhD candidate who codes and does math on a daily basis. I mainly study deep learning, model quantization/pruning, time series analysis, computer vision and statistical signal processing. I have experience in a diverse set of biomedical data analysis, brain-computer interfaces and inverse imaging problems/image reconstruction. My CV can be found [[here]](/files/denizk_cv.pdf).

My research interests include:

1. Machine learning applications for biomedical modalities
2. Model pruning and quantization
3. Domain generalization/adaptation
4. Bayesian inference and sequential decision making


Since 2019, I have been doing my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering in [University of Pittsburgh](https://pitt.edu/) where I am a member of Signal Processing and Statistical Learning Lab under [Prof. Murat Akcakaya](https://sites.google.com/site/muratakcakaya/). My research projects' main aim were to build and provide an accessible spatial neglect detection and rehabilitation systems for stroke patients with neglect. I contributed to a deep learning and AI-driven augmented-reality supported brain-computer interface. I worked on various machine learning modalities, ranging from more traditional ones like logistic regression to more complex ones like neural networks (spiking neural networks, transformers etc.). My theoretical contributions were on Bayesian inference and sequential decision making.

I received my BSc in Electronics and Communications Engineering from [Istanbul Technical University](https://www.itu.edu.tr/en) under [Prof. Ender M. Eksioglu](https://web.itu.edu.tr/eksioglue/) in 2019. I mainly focused on inverse imaging problems, more specifically MRI reconstruction and super-resolution problems.
