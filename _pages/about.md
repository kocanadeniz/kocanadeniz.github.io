I am a machine learning and signal processing expert who codes and does math on a daily basis. I specialize in developing algorithms and specifically deep learning, computer vision, and time series analysis problems. I have experience in a diverse set of biomedical data analysis, brain-computer interfaces and inverse imaging problems/image reconstruction. My CV can be found [[here]](/files/denizk_cv.pdf).

I am a Research Fellow at Boston Children's Hospital [Computational Radiology Lab](http://crl.med.harvard.edu/) - [QUIN Group] (https://labs.childrenshospital.org/quin/) since 2024. My research focuses on deep learning methods for dynamic MRI reconstruction, undersampled MRI super-resolution, and physiological parameter estimation.

I have completed my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2024 in [University of Pittsburgh](https://pitt.edu/) where I was a member of Signal Processing and Statistical Learning Lab under [Prof. Murat Akcakaya](https://sites.google.com/site/muratakcakaya/). My research projects' main aim were to build and provide an accessible spatial neglect detection and rehabilitation systems for stroke patients with neglect. I contributed to a deep learning and AI-driven augmented-reality supported brain-computer interface. I worked on various machine learning modalities, ranging from more traditional ones like logistic regression to more complex ones like neural networks (spiking neural networks, transformers etc.). My theoretical contributions were on Bayesian inference and sequential decision making.

I received my BSc in Electronics and Communications Engineering from [Istanbul Technical University](https://www.itu.edu.tr/en) under [Prof. Ender M. Eksioglu](https://web.itu.edu.tr/eksioglue/) in 2019. I mainly focused on inverse imaging problems, more specifically MRI reconstruction and super-resolution problems.
